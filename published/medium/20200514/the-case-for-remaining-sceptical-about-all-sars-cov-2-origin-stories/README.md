# The case for remaining sceptical about (all) SARS-CoV-2 origin stories…

This post does not argue the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) lab cooked up SARS-CoV-2 de-novo from a genetic design and a soup of amino acids (Craig Venter style). It does not argue that they created a chimera, using the RaTG13 genome as a base.

It does argue that one cannot scientifically exclude the possibility that the WIV lab was working on either SARS-CoV-2 or its immediate progenitor, they lost control of it, and the virus escaped into the community.

One can argue against the possibility on social grounds — “the scientists are all good people who would never lie or cover-up such a lab escape despite the global condemnation they would face if their involvement was revealed not to mention the risk of punishment by an authoritarian regime”. You can do that, but that is not a scientific argument, it is a social one and not a particularly convincing one at that.

Please understand, this post is not asserting that a lab escape occurred. It does **not** seem **unlikely** to me, given the circumstantial evidence, but no-one has ironclad proof that it did. On the other hand, there is no really strong reason of any kind, let alone of a scientific kind, to believe the opposite — that a lab escape **did not** occur.

We already know that the WIV lab held either the specimen or full genome of RaTG13 for 7 years prior to publishing the genome immediately after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This means, it is at least conceivable they had other specimens that they had not published sequences for, particularly ones like SARS-CoV-2 which is only vaguely (~78%) similar to SARS-CoV.

It was already known prior to the outbreak that the key amino acid insertion PRRA that distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from all closely related genomes was an important mechanism that allows binding to the ACE2 receptor to be more effective. This knowledge was obtained with gain of function research, a type of research that WIV is known to have participated in. It is at least conceivable that they were experimenting with this prior work on an immediate progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 and they lost control of it.

The interest since at least March 2019 in the pangolin CoV which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 may have been the reason they might have pulled an old specimen (collected in 2013, perhaps) out of the vault in order to test again the theory that inserting PRRA into the right place of a novel coronavirus would increase its ability to infect human cells. No-one knows if they did this, but it is not a possibility that is excluded by the actual evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2.

One can argue that this a just-so story that fits all the known facts and is immune from falsification, because it is. But then, so is every other origin story which has been offered. Whether it is an animal in a cage arriving at Wuhan Seafood market from literally anywhere else or a traveller who had visited Yunnan bat caves and caught the fast train back to Wuhan.

By the way, even the train traveller from Yunnan story doesn’t exclude WIV lab involvement — it might have been a researcher visiting the bat caves to collect samples. Certainly that is more likely than a travelling salesman selling pillow cases or whoever else might be on such a train.

**update**: changed terminology from 'lab release' to 'lab escape' since 'lab release' suggests an intentional release of the virus from the lab, which is not the intended interpretation.
